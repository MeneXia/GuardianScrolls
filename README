- Added optional Spout features (not included in config yet!)

COMMAND ADDITIONS:
- Using "/guardianscrolls" or "/gs" shows help
- Using "/guardianscrolls use" or "/gs use" reads one scroll and places the usage count (from config) into the skill's HashMap
- Using "/guardianscrolls use <number>" or "/gs use <number>" reads an amount of scrolls specified by the number, and places the usage count as well.
With this command, you cannot read more than 64 scrolls at once (you cannot read what's not on your hand).

TODO: - config.yml in Core needs extra additions and cleanup
- config.yml in Core's recipes only works if all items are present

- GSThieving needs cleanup and additions for CommandExecutor framework
